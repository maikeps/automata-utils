Array access:
a: tegerin[]
a [i]

Note the space between a and [i].
Also, the only acceptable way to access an array is to use constants inside the
brackets. The correct way to do this is to accept IDs and Strings.


String:
Strings in Caspal may only have lower and upper case letters, numbers and spaces.
Also, they have to be between double quotes.


Functions/Methods:
It is impossible to use/declare any function/method, due to the inexistence of
the simbols '(' and ')'.
